#Conway's Game of Life

This is a small iteration of Conways game of life. It is a zero player game. To play follow the instructions below

1. Install python version 3 on your system (skip if already installed)
2. Clone this repository locally
3. Run tut.py file in any IDE or open it in command line. The game should be up and running.

Note- 1. In case it does not run, open the terminal and type "pip install pygame"
2. Conway's Game of life is played on an infinite grid, and since it was not possible the gid is only 50x50. You can tweak some settings in the script to make it bigger. On line 25 change grid = board(50) to any number you would like to have.
